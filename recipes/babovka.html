        Here in the Czech Republic, a bábovka cake belongs to the most popular desserts made at weekends. Marble bundt cake means mramorová bábovka in Czech.
        When I was little, my dad usually made the bábovka. He prepared this lovely swirl cake the same way as in this recipe: vanilla part of bábovka generously marbled with cocoa batter.
        We were always curious about the two-color pattern inside the bábovka once we cut it open.
